Course Goals:

    - Develop a working familiarity with a BASIC STRUCTURE and USE
      of the React.js library.

    - Explore the concepts and practical use of `state and state management` 
      
    - Discover how to set up `navigation` and make use of `assets`
      in your React apps.










Course RoadMap:

    COMPONENT & COMPOSABILITY
      - Building Modern UI using concepts of component & composability
      - a website UI is simply a combination of components
      - React is so popular because it streamlines
      - the process of building & composing component.
      - doing this efficiently & withou significat impace
        on the browsers resources.


    STATE IN REACT APPS
      - State is simply all the values of all the variables your app 
        is working with at any given point in time. 

    
    STYLING YOUR REACT APPS
      - Reuse of common styles. 
      - Setting up event handling on your apps (clicks & user-submitted data)
      - Creating navigation routes and using assets.
