Principle of Component:

    PRINCIPLE OF COMPONENT ( objectives )
        - learn about the props object.
        - learn about how developers use the props object 
          to pass data from one component to another.
        - explore component hierarchy, why are they said to have a parent-child structure.



    PRINCIPLE OF COMPONENT ( props object )
        - when functional component are utilized with attributes such that 
          a component calls App and pass in data to it via its attrubute like so;
                <App title="Welcome" />

        - the key and value of the attributes are passes as arugment
          to the functional component.
                function App(props){
                    console.log(props.title);       // "Welcome"
                }
        - it is helpful to think of props as
          arguments a component can accept and are passed using JSX syntax.

        - because props is essentially a javascript object,
          attributes can accepts many data types giving developers flexibility
          when creating and working with components. 
          especially when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.



    PRINCIPLE OF COMPONENT ( props object communication )
        - when tow component communicate with each other,
        - the component sending the props data is known as the parent component
        - the component receiveing is known as the child component

        - it is not possible for the child component 
        - to send data back to the parent compoent using props.

        - functions using props are pure functions. 
        - they must never modify their own props
